This is a refresher for my react.js skills.
Been quite some time since I last worked in react
I hope to catch up with the basics again

**********************************************************
Created a react app and cleaned up all the files
Committed them all.
Now starting from scratch.

**********************************************************
Completed a counter app using react.
Can see I still have it in me
Used useState and onClick pretty well
